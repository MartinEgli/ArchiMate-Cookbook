# ArchiMate-Cookbook

Modeling Practice on "[ArchiMate Cookbook](https://www.hosiaisluoma.fi/blog/archimate/)" (from Holistic Enterprise Development)

Besides my two earlier practice repository - "[ArchiSurance](https://github.com/yasenstar/ArchiSurance_Practice)" and "[ArchiMetal](https://github.com/yasenstar/ArchiMetal_Practice)" - this is the one more modeling practice using Archi (ArchiMate Modeling Tool) to give step by step guide.

The video contents are published via Udemy (and YouTube later) as one structured courseware.

You may check [Archi](https://archimatetool.com/) time to time to get the latest version.

Enjoy your learning!
